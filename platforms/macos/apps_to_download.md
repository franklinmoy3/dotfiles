# macOS Apps to Download

## Homebrew
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is the most popular package manager for macOS. You can install it using the below one-liner (taken from the official Homebrew home page):

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## Additional Apps via Homebrew
The one-liner below will install the following apps via Homebrew: 
- LinearMouse
- Maccy
- AltTab
- BetterDisplay

```sh
brew install --cask linearmouse maccy alt-tab betterdisplay
```

I don't use Barrier much anymore, so this is optional. But, if you do want to install it, you can do so via Homebrew as well:
```sh
brew install --cask barrier
```
