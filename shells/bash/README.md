## `bash` Setup
For Windows, I still use the bundled `bash` from Git for Windows, since I don't typically develop on Windows directly (I instead try to use WSL when possible). 

## Install bash from Git for Windows
Download and install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/). `bash` is bundled and will be automatically configured during the installation process. 

## Customize `bash`
Append the contents of [.bashrc](./.bashrc) into the `.bashrc` file located in your home directory. This will run commands on each shell startup to set aliases, environment variables, etc.
